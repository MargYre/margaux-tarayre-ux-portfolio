    "luxe-threads": {
      "overview": "Luxe & Threads is a modern e-commerce platform designed for fashion enthusiasts who value both style and user experience. The project focused on creating a seamless shopping journey from browsing to checkout.",
      "challenge": "Traditional fashion e-commerce sites often struggle with high cart abandonment rates (avg. 70%) and poor mobile experiences. Users complained about cluttered interfaces and complicated checkout processes.",
      "solution": "We designed a minimalist, editorial-style interface that puts products front and center. The checkout was streamlined to 3 steps, and we implemented real-time size recommendations.",
      "process": [
        {
          "phase": "Research & Discovery",
          "description": "Conducted user interviews with 15 online shoppers, analyzed competitor sites, and identified key pain points in the checkout flow.",

      "results": [

    "campus-connect": {
      "overview": "Campus Connect is a student-centered mobile application designed specifically for Sorbonne Jussieu students. Based on extensive user research with 15+ students, the app addresses real pain points in campus life.",
      "challenge": "Students at Sorbonne Jussieu struggled with fragmented information across multiple platforms, difficulty finding study groups, and lack of real-time campus updates. Existing solutions were either too complex or didn't address specific needs.",
      "solution": "We created a unified platform that combines schedule management, study group formation, and campus news in one intuitive interface. The design prioritizes quick access to frequently used features.",

        {
          "phase": "Design & Iteration",

    "eduwatch": {
      "overview": "EduWatch is a speculative design project that explores the dystopian future of educational surveillance. Presented as a corporate product pitch, it provokes critical discussions about privacy, control, and the ethics of EdTech.",
      "challenge": "How do we make people think critically about surveillance technology in education without being preachy? How can design be used as a tool for social commentary and ethical reflection?",
      "solution": "We created a fully realized product vision—complete with features, benefits, and marketing materials—that appears legitimate on the surface but becomes increasingly unsettling upon reflection. The corporate aesthetic heightens the discomfort.",
      "process": [
        {
          "phase": "World Building",

        "Sparked 2-hour class discussion on EdTech ethics",

        "Used as teaching material in critical design course",
        "Referenced in 3 student papers on design ethics"
      ],
      "learnings": "Design fiction is most effective when it feels plausible. By presenting EduWatch as a 'real' product, we forced viewers to confront their own assumptions about technology in education. The discomfort is the point—it means people are thinking critically."
